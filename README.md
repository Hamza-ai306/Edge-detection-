# Edge-detection-
Project demonstrates real-time edge detection using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python. The tool allows users to input any image and observe how edge detection algorithms identify boundaries and shapes within the image. This is especially useful in applications such as object recognition, motion detection, and image segmentation.
