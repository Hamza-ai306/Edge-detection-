# Real-Time Edge Detection Using OpenCV

This project is a Python-based tool that performs real-time edge detection on images using OpenCV.
It includes both Canny and Sobel edge detection methods, along with interactive threshold controls.

## Features
- Load and process images in real-time
- Adjustable Canny thresholds using OpenCV trackbars
- Sobel edge detection with X and Y gradients
- Real-time visualization of original and edge-detected images

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed: `pip install opencv-python`
2. Run the script: `python edge_detection.py`
3. Enter the image path when prompted

Press `Esc` to close the windows.
